# SchoolApp

This is a Spring Web Application that's built with structural architecture and uses Stream API, Jdbc as well as PostgreSql as it's dbms. <br/>
It takes student and teacher info and stores them in their corresponding tables in the database and creates a correlation between them. <br/>

I'm currently working on this project with the help of my course teacher Oguz Karan. <br/> 
I'm trying to implement the things I learned from there in a seperate project in order to practice.
